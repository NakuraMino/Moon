## Who I am

Hi there! I'm a currently a third-year CSE undergrad at the UW, teaching assistant for the introductory programming courses (currently on break), and (former) research assistant for the ConCodeIt! team at the <a href='https://hcrlab.cs.washington.edu/'>Human-Centered Robotics Lab</a>! In the summer, I will be working at Microsoft, under the Azure Product Infrastructure Engineering (PIE) team.

Outside of School, I'm a casual <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67088130-mino-nakura">book reader</a> and Sounders/Man. United fan. I also have a dog
named Kohaku.
