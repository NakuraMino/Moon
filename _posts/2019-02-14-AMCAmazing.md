Bouncer /NOUN/ [baun-ser]: one that bounces: such as a. One employed to restrain or eject disorderly persons b. A bouncing ground ball

When you imagine a bouncer, a stocky, muscular man in a suit with dark-tinted sunglasses pops up to mind. He has a low, gruff voice and marshalls the entrance door, upholding an absolute no-nonsense policy, ready to pounce on the first rat that tries to squeak past him. Undesirables are mercilessly cast away to the side, and only those with exclusive prerogative are welcomed by the intimidating man. 

Even if I were to wear a suit and wear shady sunglasses, no one would mistake me for a bouncer. I have weak, feeble arms, a hunch, and a face that wouldn’t terrify a child. I cower at the first sign of conflict, and will do anything and everything to avoid it. 

The first assigned job I received was the role of a greeter. Now, the work of a greeter is very different from the work of a bouncer. You smile more, frown less. But the tasks generally remain the same: only those with tickets are welcome, and you refuse entrance to those that break any rules (mostly means they’re just trying to bring in food). Your first tasks anywhere often remain in memory with surprising clarity, and to this day, I still remember the first time I greeted. I left the iPhone scanner on the counter, and the words of caution to not leave such an expensive commodity unattended still rings in my ears. I also recall with shame of when I had to ask which part of the ripped ticket I return to the guest and which part I keep. Clumsy mistakes are inevitabilities on the first day of work, and one has a difficult time accommodating to the pure volume of guests pouring into the lobby. To those new hires, do not press the panic button just yet.  Make mistakes, ask questions. Nobody expects you to perfect every single task. Perfection is not a requisite for any job.

The other day, as I was filling up the candy cart in the stockroom, a white sign hanging from the rails caught my eye. The sign read:

 “you are AMC Amazing!”
 What IS AMC Amazing?

My favorite memories at AMC come from when I worked concessions. As one of the employees (I forgot who) said, “I’d rather be serving the mess than cleaning up the mess.” But beyond that, serving popcorn is much more than just another “simple chore.”

Growing up, I never had many opportunities to make friends. Of course I went to school, met new people, played games with others, but on the whole, I never approached and was never approached by anyone. Socialization was a skill that eluded me. The close proximity I worked with the other concessionists gave me the opportunity to bond with others. Whether it was simply competing to see who could sell the most membership cards, or just popping popcorn, I felt welcomed by those around me. People you meet at work are called “co-workers,” but, to me, those bonds created are much more beautiful than the word suggests. Our friendships with each other are young, as are we. We grow up, and we may forget about our work here. But as I said earlier, firsts are hard to forget. You guys are the first friends I made since becoming an adult.

Hopefully, I won’t forget you.

I will walk into the movie theater a year from now, and walk out struggling to understand the reality of life, and I imagine you will too. Unfamiliar faces will swarm the theater and plague the crew. Variables that you assumed were universal constants will transfigure with alarming velocity into unknown figures. Names you thought were inseparable from AMC will fade away, and the management team will make wholesale changes. It is a simple truth that nothing in life will last forever, and we are no exception.
Yet, right now, our lives are at a standstill. During our 30-minute  breaks, we will sink into the black couch on the second floor and wonder, when will my life ever change? Will I ever see the real world? Every day is a repeat of the previous day, and our lives digress into a series of repetitive tasks and dull conversations with guests; we complain and shake our heads as we work our closing night shifts; the occasional rude guest will spit in our faces and demand for a refund. None of us enjoy the constant ramblings of guests. Simply put, we hate it. More than that, we are forced to mask up our personal lives and remain professional: maintain a positive attitude, greet guests with a smile, hide your own insecurities, the list goes on. Of course, the option to quit the job is always available, but some of us actually need money. Thus, we persist. 
To me, this is what it means to be AMC Amazing. We cake up our faces with makeup to maintain fake smiles; we tune our voices to provide a warm welcome; we reprogram our cynical personalities to help our guests. The purpose of life disappears and we become robots, only existing to please someone we ultimately don’t care about.

Today, you will be serving popcorn. Tomorrow, you will be sitting on the couch wondering when your life will change. A year from now, you will come back, amazed at how everything has changed.

Compared to most of you guys, I am younger and have not worked here for long. As my time here dwindles down, however, I must impart a few words to you all. The vast memories I created here are far more positive than negative. We tend to cherish things only when they are gone, as it is in my case. For now, it is okay to hate; it is okay to despair. But a year from now you will be somewhere else. Stay patient, stay resilient. Your time to live will come. 

One day, you will be more than AMC amazing.
