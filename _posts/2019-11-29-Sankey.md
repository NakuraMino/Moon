## Introduction

I saw a lot of people make sankey diagrams of their recruitment processes, so I thought I would do the same. This diagram show how my internship search for summer 2020 went.

## Motivation

As the amount of rejection letters piled up, I started to wonder what my ratios were looking like. I also wanted a quick and dirty summary of my statistics, and this was just an efficient way of doing so.

## How I coded this project

I made the Sankey Diagram using Google's <a href='https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/sankey'> visualization tool.</a> I kept track of all my applications in a csv file, and I parsed them using python. The results were compiled into a .txt file, and I used that to make my Sankey Diagram in javascript.
