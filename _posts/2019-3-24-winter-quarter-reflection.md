Last Thursday, I walked out of Kane Hall after finishing my last final. It was for my Data Structures class, a class that everyone says is essential for internship interviews. I was feeling a little down because I wasn’t able to solve one of the questions on the final, and because my high hopes that I could do well in the class were partially crushed.

Nevertheless, I was excited to finish the quarter. Winter quarter had been especially tough to me, and I was eager to take a break from school. I felt that the classes I took were especially challenging, and I was exhausted from balancing school work with my job as a teaching assistant. I often fell behind in lectures and struggled to complete the homeworks and projects. Even more, I was frustrated at myself for being overwhelmed, all while my peers were seemingly effortlessly keeping up with schoolwork. 

What made the quarter even more frustrating was the fact that all my friends were getting accepted into internships at well-known companies. Before the school year started, I vaguely had the impression that I wanted to work as an intern for the next summer. However, I vastly underestimated the amount of preparation required to hunt for an internship. As a result, my resume was plain and stood out in the worst way possible. So, when recruiting season came around, I was basically invisible. Companies wouldn’t even look my way, and applications submitted online came back attached with a rejection email.

Although the pain that comes with rejection is substantial, I must also remind myself that, to a certain extent, I used to scorn at the idea of internships. I felt that searching for internships were an ingenuine process, one in which students were “snakes.” None of them truly cared for the company they were applying to; they just cared for the prestige and job security. I couldn’t come to terms with these ideas, and I felt that I wanted to be better than that. Instead of looking for a job that boosted my ego, I wanted to let things come to me naturally. I felt that if I kept on working hard in school and “pursue my passion,” an internship that fit me would fall my way. 

Looking back, I can’t believe how naïve I was. To begin with, I’m not even sure that I know what my passion is. My understanding of the field of Computer Science is still shallow, and I am still overwhelmed by the potential paths I could take. Second, when all is done and dusted, I would rather prefer to be a “snake” and have an internship rather than to be a martyr for my idealistic beliefs and waste away my summer. I didn’t have the foresight to look ahead. I convinced myself that, when the time comes, I could find an internship that fit my needs. Instead, I’m faced with the hard truth that internships aren’t made for me. Instead, I’m left with the reality that I need to be ready-made for them, and, if I’m not, then someone else will be.

Now, as things are settling down, the quarter is over, and I am left reflecting on myself, I can only say that I have to do a better job next year. The best thing I can do for myself is to prepare for the upcoming recruiting season and give my best. I have to admit that I’m pretty scared for my future internship prospects. However, I can’t change whether recruiters will like me or not. The only thing I can change is myself. This upcoming quarter will be a good litmus test. I have a lot more time from not TA-ing, and I am taking a lighter course load than last quarter. I have to channel my free time into meaningful production. Only time will tell if I am up to the challenge.
